# Frontend Tools

> Let your agent interact with and update your application's UI.



<!-- interactive demo: frontend-tools -->


<Callout type="info" title="See this in Inspector">
  Open Inspector on localhost. Go to **Agents**, then **Frontend Tools**.
  Your tool and its schema are listed.

## What is this?

Frontend tools let your agent define and invoke client-side functions that run entirely in the user's browser. Because the handler executes on the frontend, it has direct access to component state, browser APIs, and any third-party UI library the page already uses. That's how an agent can "reach into" the app: update React state, trigger animations, read `localStorage`, pop a toast, or steer the user's view.

This page covers the "agent drives the UI" shape of frontend tools. The same primitive also powers Generative UI and Human-in-the-loop; see those pages for interaction patterns.

## When should I use this?

Use frontend tools when your agent needs to:

- Read or modify React component state
- Access browser APIs like `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or cookies
- Trigger UI updates, animations, or transitions
- Show alerts, toasts, or notifications
- Interact with third-party frontend libraries
- Perform anything that requires the user's immediate browser context

## How it works in code

<Steps>

    ### Nothing to wire on the agent

    The AG-UI hosting layer merges the request's tool definitions into the tool
    list the model sees, so the agent declares none of its own. A component
    registered with `useComponent` reaches the model by name. The harness takes
    its tool list through `ChatOptions`, and leaving `Tools` empty is correct
    when the only tools in play are frontend ones.

    ```csharp title="agent/ChartAgent.cs"
    using Microsoft.Agents.AI;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.AI;

    private const int HarnessMaxContextWindowTokens = 128_000;
    private const int HarnessMaxOutputTokens = 8_192;

    public AIAgent CreateChartAgent()
    {
        var chatClient = _openAiClient.GetChatClient("gpt-6-luna").AsIChatClient();

        return chatClient.AsHarnessAgent(
            HarnessMaxContextWindowTokens,
            HarnessMaxOutputTokens,
            new HarnessAgentOptions
            {
                Name = "ChartAgent",
                Description = "Renders charts from data.",
                ChatOptions = new ChatOptions
                {
                    Instructions = SystemPrompt,
                    MaxOutputTokens = HarnessMaxOutputTokens,
                    Tools = [],
                },
            });
    }
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Tell the model when to call it

    This is the part that is easy to miss. The tool arrives on every run, but a
    model with no instruction about it will answer in prose and never call it.
    Name the tool in `Instructions` and say what it is for.

    ```csharp title="agent/ChartAgent.cs"
    private const string SystemPrompt = """
        You are a data visualization assistant.
        When the user asks for a chart, call render_bar_chart with a concise
        title, description, and data array of {label, value} items.
        Keep final chat responses brief.
        """;
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

Register a frontend tool with `useFrontendTool`. Give it a name, a Zod schema for parameters, and a handler. The agent can then call it like any other tool and your frontend runs it in the browser.

```typescript
// src/app/demos/frontend-tools/page.tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import {
  CopilotKit,
  CopilotSidebar,
  useFrontendTool,
} from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
import { z } from "zod";
import { Background, DEFAULT_BACKGROUND } from "./background";
import { useFrontendToolsSuggestions } from "./suggestions";

function Chat() {
  const [background, setBackground] = useState<string>(DEFAULT_BACKGROUND);

  useFrontendTool({
    name: "change_background",
    description:
      "Change the page background. Accepts any valid CSS background value — colors, linear or radial gradients, etc.",
    parameters: z.object({
      background: z
        .string()
        .describe("The CSS background value. Prefer gradients."),
    }),
    handler: async ({ background }) => {
      setBackground(background);
      return { status: "success" };
    },
  });
```

The handler receives the parsed, type-safe parameters and can do anything
the browser can: update state, call an API, touch the DOM. Its return value
is sent back to the agent as the tool result so the model can reason about
what happened.

```typescript
// src/app/demos/frontend-tools/page.tsx
    handler: async ({ background }) => {
      setBackground(background);
      return { status: "success" };
    },
```

## Registering a list of tools

`useFrontendTool` registers one tool per call, so it cannot be called in a loop
over a list whose length changes between renders. When the set of tools comes
from state, from props, or from a backend response, use
[`useFrontendTools`](/reference/hooks/useFrontendTools) instead. It takes an
array and runs a single effect over it, so the array can be empty on one render
and hold twenty entries on the next.

```tsx
useFrontendTools(
  reports.map((report) => ({
    name: `open_${report.id}`,
    description: `Open the ${report.title} report`,
    handler: async () => navigate(`/reports/${report.id}`),
  })),
  [navigate],
);
```

Tools that leave the array are unregistered, tools that join it are registered,
and a re-render that produces an equal list does not re-register anything. A
description built from your data stays current on its own. The second argument
is for values a handler closes over, such as `navigate` above.
